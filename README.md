## Print Sequence Calculator

NOT yet complete and documented!

This app is designed to help the user before the printing process of a document.
The target user needs to print a document on both sides of a sheet but does not
own an automatic duplex printer and or the software managing the document
is not capable to separately print even/odd pages.

The user needs to manually insert even/odd pages and this for larger documents
could really be a trouble causing mistakes and waste of time and paper if
the sequence is broken.

With this app the user just provides the document's number of pages, or an
interval of pages.
The app automatically provides both the even and odd sequences ready for a copy
and paste, the number of sheets needed for the operation.

This is it, just a simple tool to save time.
